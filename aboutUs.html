        <p id="longtext">Stanley Ken Limited was developed by Stanley Ken (1872â€“1959) after he inherited his father's saddlery business on Winnipeg's Smith Street at the age of 21 in 1893. <br><br>Stanley Ken developed a line of automobile accessories called "Stanley's Motorities". This first collection included car horns and lamps, leather overcoats, goggles, picnic sets and timepieces, which provided the company with the strap line of "Everything But The Motor". 
            <br><br>Within a few years, the business moved towards the luxury market with the opening of two Stanley Motorities stores in Mayfair. In 1904 Stanley had patented a "Windshield Pipe" to help a driver smoke while driving. <br><br>Stanley Ken's first tobacconist and pipe shop opened in 1907 on Duke Street. Stanley retired from the business in the 1920s, 
            leaving the position of managing director and president to his brother Alfred-Henry, then daughter Mary, and finally his grandson Richard.</p>
